# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches you how to think and solve complex problems systematically.

**Data Structures** is about how data can be stored in different structures.

**Algorithms** is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.

Data structures give us the possibility to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.

Data structures are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help in managing and organizing data, reduce complexity, and increase efficiency.

In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.

- **Primitive Data Structures** are basic data structures provided by programming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.

- **Abstract Data Structures** are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

**Algorithm examples:**

- Finding the fastest route in a GPS navigation system
- Navigating an airplane or a car (cruise control)
- Finding what users search for (search engine)
- Sorting, for example sorting movies by rating

DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, and to solve specific problems.
